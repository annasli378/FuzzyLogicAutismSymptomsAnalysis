# Fuzzy Logic based system for analysing symptoms of autism in children

The main objective of the project was to develop a fuzzy system that allows early assessment of the probability of autism in children under the age of 3 and to indicate further recommendations for parents.

## About
Early signs of autism in a child may include : 
- atypical eye contact,
- lack of response to messages directed to the child,
- insufficient reciprocation of social smiles,
- impoverished vocalization,

- lack of emotional attunement to emotions shown by others,
- lack of spontaneous pointing to objects of interest in the environment,
- lack of following with the eyes a person, a toy being shown, etc,
- lack of understanding and imitation of gestures.

## Methods od diagnosis:
Q-10 system
Q-4 system

## Proposed solution:
